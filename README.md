Welcome to my github page, hopefully you will find something useful here.  

I am a cloud solutions architect and DevOps enthusiast mainly working with Microsoft technologies in the Azure cloud platform and also utilizing automation and source control tools such as Git, Azure Devops and GitHub.  
I also specialize in infrastructure as code (specifically Terraform) and love writing modules which I publish on the public [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).  
I also have a big passion for PowerShell and PowerShell development.  
When it comes to cloud technology, I usually blog and go where my curiosity takes me.  

### This github space is mainly used for

- Terraform Module Development (Publishing on [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)).
- Blog Posts (Publishing on [Dev](https://dev.to/pwd9000)).
- PowerShell development and general PowerShell community fun.
- Contributing to open source projects and issues
- Learning and sharing knowledge

Feel free to contribute to any of my project repositories by submitting a pull request.  
Thanks for visiting.
