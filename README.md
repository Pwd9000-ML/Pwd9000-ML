### Bio

Welcome to my github page, hopefully you will find something useful here.  
I am a Microsoft DevOps MVP, Cloud Solutions & DevOps Architect and technical speaker focussed on Microsoft technologies in the Azure cloud platform and specialize particularly in Automation, DevOps and Developer Technologies, with a strong focus on IaC, Azure DevOps and GitHub.

I am passionate about technology and how it can be used in automation to bring value and solve complex business problems.

Regular speaker at conferences and meetups, and enjoys sharing knowledge and technical content with the wider tech community. Currently works at Avanade UK&I as a Manager for DevOps Engineering.
Check out my **[Tech Community Activity Timeline](https://dev.to/pwd9000/my-tech-community-activity-timeline-57lf)** for a summary and timeline of all my blog articles, tutorials, public speaking and upcoming events I will be presenting at.  

I specialize in infrastructure as code (specifically Terraform) and love writing modules which I publish on the public [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).  
I also have a big passion for PowerShell and PowerShell development.  
When it comes to cloud technology, I usually blog and go where my curiosity takes me covering topics on Azure, DevOps and GitHub.  

### This github space is mainly used for

- Terraform Module Development (Publishing on [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)).
- Blog Posts (Publishing on [Dev](https://dev.to/pwd9000)).
- PowerShell development and general PowerShell community fun.
- Contributing to open source projects and issues
- Learning and sharing knowledge

Feel free to contribute to any of my project repositories by submitting a pull request.  
Thanks for visiting.
