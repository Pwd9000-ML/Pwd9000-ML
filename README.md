Welcome to my github page, hopefully you will find something useful here.  
Check out my **[Tech Community Activity Timeline](https://dev.to/pwd9000/my-tech-community-activity-timeline-57lf)** for a summary and timeline of all my blog articles, tutorials, public speaking and upcoming events I will be presenting at.  

I am a Cloud Solutions & DevOps Architect mainly working with Microsoft technologies in the Azure cloud platform and also utilizing automation and source control tools such as Git, Azure Devops and GitHub.  
I also specialize in infrastructure as code (specifically Terraform) and love writing modules which I publish on the public [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).  
I also have a big passion for PowerShell and PowerShell development.  
When it comes to cloud technology, I usually blog and go where my curiosity takes me covering topics on Azure, DevOps and GitHub.  

### This github space is mainly used for

- Terraform Module Development (Publishing on [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)).
- Blog Posts (Publishing on [Dev](https://dev.to/pwd9000)).
- PowerShell development and general PowerShell community fun.
- Contributing to open source projects and issues
- Learning and sharing knowledge

Feel free to contribute to any of my project repositories by submitting a pull request.  
Thanks for visiting.
